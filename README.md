A Two-level Learning Framework of Fake Portrait Videos Tracing

## Abstract

Fake Portrait Videos Tracing, which investigates the fake portrait videos and traces source videos from suspected video database at frame level, is a newly proposed challenging task for video forensics. Here, we propose the first solution exploiting two-level learning framework to trace fake portrait videos. Our approach mainly consists of two stages. First, the scene tracing stage aims to retrieve the most similar source video to the input fake portrait video from the suspected video database based on the scene features. Second, the optical flow tracing stage aims to locate the most similar source clip to the input fake portrait video from the retrieved source video based on the motion modes. After that, the source video of the input fake portrait video can be traced at frame level precisely.

## FakeDT Dataset

We released a fake portrait videos tracing dataset, named FakeTD, to support the development of more effective fake portrait videos tracing methods. The FakeTD dataset can be downloaded from https://pan.baidu.com/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (Password: xxxx).
